# What is an Audit?

An audit is a security focused code review for looking for issues with your code. 

# Process

An auditors process looks like this:

1. Run tests
2. Read specs/docs
3. Run fast tools (like slither, linters, static analysis, etc)
4. Manual Analysis
5. Run slow tools (like echidna, manticore, symbolic execution, MythX)
6. Discuss (and repeat steps as needed)
7. Write report ([Example report](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/tree/main/audits))

Typically, you organize reports in a chart that looks like this:
